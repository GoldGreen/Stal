[06.04.2021 10:02:33] The LINQ expression 'EnumerableQuery<DateTime> { 01.01.2018 23:17:00, }
    .Select(x => StalDBContext.LinkedGetBrigadeWithShift(x))' could not be translated. Either rewrite the query in a form that can be translated, or switch to client evaluation explicitly by inserting a call to 'AsEnumerable', 'AsAsyncEnumerable', 'ToList', or 'ToListAsync'.
